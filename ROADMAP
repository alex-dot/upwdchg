Universal Password Changer (UPwdChg)
====================================

TODO
----

The following features are already in the pipe for short-/mid-term development:

* Allow use of ECDSA cryptography

  NOTE:
  - as of PHP 7.0 (Debian/Stretch):
    "key type not supported in this PHP build!"
  - as of Python M2Crypto 0.24.0 (Debian/Stretch):
    only RSA asymmetric cryptography supported (as per source code)

  README.keys (addendum):

  ECDSA private/public keys
  -------------------------

  Start by picking a curve (see http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ for help):

    $ openssl ecparam -list openssl ecparam -list_curves

  To generated the required private/public keys/files, in PEM format:

    $ touch private.pem && chmod go= private.pem && openssl ecparam -name brainpoolP384t1 -genkey -noout -out private.pem
    $ openssl ec -in private.pem -out public.pem -outform PEM -pubout
