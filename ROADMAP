Universal Password Changer (UPwdChg)
====================================

TODO
----

The following features are already in the pipe for short-/mid-term development:

 * 'CreateAccountAdFromLdap' processing plugin; check whether the user account
   corresponding to the pasword change token already exists in Microsoft Active
   Directory and create it - based on its LDAP counterpart - if needs be.
